### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8,part 3, was a favorite because I was
    always interested in how animations work and how
    code can be related to making them.I was able to
    write loops and incorporate the ifstream
    variable input_file_stream while understanding
    its role for the first time. I was able to write
    a program that would play an animation if a
    specific file was named and would stop and allow
    the user to input another file name. 

Lab 10

   Lab 10, part 3, was a favorite because the
   outcome was not just a sentence or some number
   but an image which I thought was really
   interesting that it came from lines of code that
   were made. This was also one of the labs that
   were 2 parts in one which was a bit of a headache
   in making and tedious but nonetheless it got done
   and it is a piece of work that I have pride in
   taking part of. Nested loops were used to create
   the certain colors depending on the row and
   column.

Lab 12

  Lab 12, part 1, was a favorite because similar to
  lab 10 part 3 the outcome wasn't a sentence or
  numbers but an image, only his time said image is
  animated. Same aspects were used however the sine
  function was used to help determine the color
  fluctuating effect, this accompanied with some
  nested loops helped create the cool effects. This
  part also had 2 parts within meaning it had a
  function outside of the main which made the end
  result only that much better.
